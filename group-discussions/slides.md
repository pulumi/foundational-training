# Discussion: Platform Engineering

## What does platform engineering look like in your org/for your customers?

* What is the developer experience, e.g. how much is self-service?
* What tooling is being used?
* How is governance managed, e.g. how do you choose what platforms or services to support?
* How is compliance and security enforced?
* What are the biggest challenges in adoption? How are they solved?
* How does the platform team interface with application teams?
* How do you collect feedback or otherwise ensure the platform serves the needs of app teams?
