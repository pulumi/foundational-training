# **Module 05: Organizing Programs and Stacks**

---

# Stack Configuration (Review)

- Each stack has its own config file `Pulumi.{STACK_NAME}.yaml`, e.g.`Pulumi.dev.yaml` or `Pulumi.prod.yaml`
- Setting config values:

    ```bash
    $ pulumi config set my-key my-value
    $ cat Pulumi.dev.yaml
    config:
      project-name:my-key: my-value
    ```

- Reading config values:

    ```typescript
    const config = new pulumi.Config();
    const optionalValue = config.get("some-optional-value") || "default-value";
    const requiredValue = config.require("some-required-value");
    // also, getBoolean(), getRequiredInt(), etc.
    ```

---

# Using Multiple Stacks in a Single Program

- Represent roughly identical environments, e.g.:
  - dev/stage/prod
  - SaaS tenants
  - primary/disaster recovery
- Create a new stack: `pulumi stack init prod`
- Change the current stack: `pulumi stack select staging`
- List stacks: `pulumi stack ls`

---

# Stack Config w/Multiple Stacks

- Use config to control differences, e.g.:
  - `pulumi config set desiredNodeCount 3`
  - `pulumi config set logRetentionDays 90`
  - `pulumi config set apiKey abc123 --secret`
- Commit all stack config files to git, but **be sure to correctly mark secrets!!!**
- Can use ESC to manage config at scale.

---

# Organizing Stacks, Example: Pulumi Cloud @ Pulumi

How we use stacks in our SaaS product (Pulumi Cloud):

- Individual developer stacks used w/feature branches
- Staging stack on`main` branch w/continuous delivery
- Production deployments on-demand
- 139 stack config parameters

---

# Stack References

- Retrieve outputs from one stack in another stack
- Limit blast radius
- Define areas of ownership

```typescript
const stackRef = new pulumi.StackReference("other-stack", {
  name: "org-name/project-name/stack-name"
});

const vpcId = stackRef.getOutput("vpcId"); // implicitly pulumi.Output<string>
const privateSubnetIds = stackRef.getOutput("privateSubnetIds") as pulumi.Output<string[]>;

// use outputs to create additional resources
```

---

# Stack Outputs/References: Best Practices

**Do** share only what you _know_ is actually consumed downstream. (Limit fan-out.)

**Don't** add outputs "just in case". It's code and therefore is malleable. Submit a PR if a change is needed.

This means:

- Remove stack outputs when they are (definitively) no longer needed (code as documentation!)

**Note:** Nuances apply if your organization is enormous where you can't possibly know all downstream consumers. In this case, be much more careful about breaking changes.

---

# Stack Outputs/References: Best Practices

**Do not** share entire resources. Unnecessary performance hit and churn on values.

```typescript
// Do not do this:
export const vpc = new awsx.ec2.Vpc("my-full-vpc");
```

**Do** share stable IDs and query for the entire object in the referencing stack, e.g.:

```typescript
// Parent stack:
const vpc = new awsx.ec2.Vpc("my-full-vpc");
export vpcId = vpc.vpcId;
```

```typescript
const vpcId = stackRef.getOutput("vpcId");
const existingVpc = aws.ec2.Vpc.Get(vpcId);
const serviceSecGroup = new aws.ec2.SecurityGroup("security-group", {
  vpcId: vpcId,
  ingress: [{
    cidrBlocks: [vpc.cidrBlock],
    // ...
```

# Organizing Programs: Principles

- Align with team ownership and the org chart (Conway's Law)
- Limit blast radius
- Pulumi Cloud automatically prevents concurrent stack updates
- Things that change together should live together:

  If you see yourself consistently making changes in multiple repos (app or infra code) or multiple folders, then your code organization is probably not optimal.

---

# Organizing Repos and Programs, Example: Early Startup (Pre-Product Market Fit)

- Small number of engineers
- Monorepo is fine at this stage
  - Side note: Monolith is also the appropriate app architecture
- App code in the same repo with infrastructure, assuming workloads are containerized or serverless
- Deploy everything every time

---

# Organizing Repos, Example: Multi-Team Enterprise

- Each team has its own repo or repos:
  - Ease of access controls
  - Clear boundaries of ownership
  - Unit of work/deployment is simple to determine (git commit)
  - Allow outside contributions if feasible!
- Common example:
  - Networking team/repos: VPCs, TGW, centralized egress, firewall rules, load balancers
  - Platform team/repos: EKS clusters, RDS clusters, S3 buckets, backup storage, container registries
  - Application teams/repos: Containers, related K8s resources
