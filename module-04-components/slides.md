# **Module 06: Components and Modularity**

---

## Overview

* What is a Custom Resource?
* What is a Component Resource?
* Building Component Resources
* Sharing Component Resources
* Multi-Language Components

---

## What is a Custom Resource?

* Base resource of a provider
* Has inputs and outputs

---

## What is a Component Resource?

* **Re-usable** group of custom resources that will usually be deployed together
* Similar to TF module or CDK construct
* Gives ability to create abstractions over commonly used goals
* Can have inputs and output

<!-- Re-usable emphasis -->

---

## Building a Component Resource

* Class that extends `pulumi.ComponentResource`
* Create resources in or via contructor
* Outputs are properties of the class

---

## Component Resource Example: TypeScript

```typescript
export interface MyComponentArgs {
  bucketSuffix: pulumi.Input<string>,
}

export class MyComponent extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    public readonly bucketDomainName: pulumi.Output<string>;

    constructor(name: string, args: MyComponentArgs, opts: pulumi.ComponentResourceOptions = {}) {
      // This must always be called first:
      super("myPackage:index:MyComponent", name, {}, opts);

      // Create resources, remembering to template the resource name and set parent:
      const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket(`${name}-${args.bucketSuffix}`,
        {/*...*/},
        { parent: this }
      );

      // Create an output that can be accessed by the calling program:
      this.bucketDomainName = bucket.bucketDomainName

      // This must always be called last:
      this.registerOutputs({
          bucketDomainName: bucket.bucketDomainName,
      })
    }
}
```

---

## Component Resource Example 2: Typescript

```typescript
export interface MyComponentArgs {
  bucketSuffix: pulumi.Input<string>,
}

export interface MyComponentData {
    bucketDns: string
}

export class MyComponent extends pulumi.ComponentResource {
    public readonly bucketDomainName: pulumi.Output<string>;

    constructor(name: string, args: MyComponentArgs, opts: pulumi.ComponentResourceOptions = {}) {
      // This must always be called first:
      super("myPackage:index:MyComponent", name, { name, args, opts }, opts);

      this.bucketDomainName = pulumi.output(this.getData())

      // This must always be called last:
      this.registerOutputs({
          bucketDomainName: this.bucketDomainName,
      })
    }

    protected async initialize(props: {
        name: string,
        args: MyComponentArgs,
        opts: pulumi.ComponentResourceOptions
    }): Promise<any> {
        const { name, args } = props;

        // Create resources, remembering to template the resource name and set parent:
        const bucket = new aws.s3.Bucket(`${name}-${args.bucketSuffix}`,
            {/*...*/},
            { parent: this }
        );

        return {
            bucketDns: bucket.bucketDomainName
        };
    }
}
```

## Component Resource Example: Python

```python
@dataclass
class MyComponentArgs:
    bucket_suffix: pulumi.Input[str]


class MyComponent(pulumi.ComponentResource):
  def __init__(self, name: str, args: MyComponentArgs, opts: pulumi.ResourceOptions = None) -> None:

    # This must always be called first:
    super().__init__("myPackage:index:MyComponent", name, None, opts)

    # Create resources, remembering to template the resource name and set `parent`:
    bucket = aws.s3.Bucket(
      f"{name}-{args.bucket_suffix}",
      pulumi.ResourceOptions()
    )

    # Create an output that can be accessed by the calling program:
    self.bucket_domain_name = bucket.bucket_domain_name

    # This must always be called last:
    self.register_outputs({
        "bucket_domain_name": self.bucket_domain_name
    })
```

---

## Sharing Code in a Single Language

* Publish packages via npm, PyPI, etc.
* Consumable only in the same language as they are authored

---

## Multi-language Components/Packages

Multi-Language Components are ComponentResources that are compiled to a provider-like binary, have a schema, and SDKs generated in all Pulumi languages.

* Examples: `awsx`, `eks`, etc.
* Requires authoring a schema (less mature tooling compared to authoring providers)
* Requires producing an SDK in every supported language (need credentials for each language's package feed)

---

## Multi-language Components/Packages: Best Fit

Multi-language components are non-trivial to write and maintain, and are best suited for components that are consumed by a wide audience in multiple languages:

* **For internal use** in very large, high-functioning orgs with many teams that run their own infra and do not use the same language. (MAANG-scale or SaaS platform orgs, e.g. Uber.)
* **For use with customers** for large system implementers that want to reuse components across multiple engagements.
* **For external use** for cloud providers who want to publish their own constructs to be consumed in all Pulumi languages.
