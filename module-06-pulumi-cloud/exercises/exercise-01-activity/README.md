# Exercise 01 - Pulumi Cloud Activity

## Pre-requisites

* Pulumi Cloud account
* Access to the `stark-tech` organisation (let me know if you need the invite code again)
* A sense of adventure and wonder

## Project/Stack listings

Click on the `Stacks` link on the left hand side menu.

Although you can click through to all the stacks, the one of interest is the `dev` stack in the `aws-training-module-02-cluster` project.

## Overview

This tab shows the state of the stack since the last update.

Worth noting that the outputs are shown here, and the `kubeconfig` has been marked as a secret so you won't be able to view it here. Ever.

You can click on the `helloworldurl` link though. The page is not served over HTTPS so you may get a warning in your browser.

## README

This can be used as a playbook for useful links and docs to help you successfully operate the resources in this stack.

## Updates

Make sure you're on the updates of the dev stack (<https://app.pulumi.com/stark-tech/aws-training-module-02-cluster/dev/updates>). Although this took place over a few hours, you can see how the stack has built up over time, with adding a removing resources.

Click on the commit for an update to see the code change in GitHub.

You can click on the "Details" link to view what actually changes, the outputs, resources and metadad at the time the update completed and any policies that were run (hint, none).

## Resources

The list of resources that makes up the current version of this stack.
